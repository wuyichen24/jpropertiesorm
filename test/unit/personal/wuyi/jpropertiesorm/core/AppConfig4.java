/**
 * Application configuration class example
 * 
 * <p>This class is an example to show the binding between the instance 
 * members in java class and the parameters in the external configuration file 
 * by annotation.
 * 
 * <p>This class will use the static block to trigger the operation of 
 * grabbing the parameters from the external configuration file and populate 
 * them into the static fields of this class. 
 * 
 * <p>
 * This solution is similar to the AppConfig3, and it has some drawbacks:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>Any exception in static block can not be thrown out. So you have to put
 * try-catch block in that static block. Because of the process is in static
 * phrase, so that it may not be logged if there is any exception in that
 * process.
 * <li>This class can only map to one external configuration.
 * </ul>
